# Employee Tracker - SQL

## My Task

Interfaces are such a commonly created tool that developers build for those who do not develop. This allows the non-developer to smoothly interact with and view stored information inside of databases. These interfaces are called **(CMS) Content Management Systems**. My assignment was to build from scratch a command-line application that can manage company's employee database. I have done this using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

I have installed the `Inquirer` package and it is up to date with the Inquirer 8.2.4 version.

Because this application won't be deployed, I have also recorded a walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality required and showcases that with the following acceptance criteria being met.

## User Story

```
AS An owner of a striving business
I WANT to have access to viewable documentation of departments, roles, and employees in my company 
SO THAT I can manage, organize and plan business thoroughly 
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```

```

## Mock-Up

The following video is an example given to me to demonstrate how the application is to be used from the command line:
